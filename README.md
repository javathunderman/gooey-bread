# gooey-bread
GUI wrapper for mining Garlicoin with CCMiner. 

If you are new to Garlicoin or cryptomining in general, this program makes things easy! Just download/clone this repository, launch your terminal window, and type "python3 run-gooeybread.py". If you're mining for the first time, choose "first run", and Gooey Bread will automatically install the required packages. 

Then just paste in your pool and wallet addresses and you should be good to go!

At this time, Gooey Bread only supports CCMiner with Nvidia GPUs on (Ubuntu) Linux. 

# Requirements

Before running Gooey Bread, make sure you have the following packages installed. They are preinstalled with most versions of Linux. 

- Python 3 (with Tkinter)
- Git
